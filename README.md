MileStone 3 Full Stack Software Development Course at Code Institute. Visit [gitRepo](https://github.com/MACmidiDEV/CInst-M3-Data-Centric-Development/commits/master) for entire build information. The main focus of this project was to create, develop and deploy a mongoDB database connected web application hosted on [Heroku](https://little-links-learning.herokuapp.com/) Little Links Learning is a application parents can utilize free of charge and not only have access to a collection of Learning Links but given full CRUD functionality as a contributor.

## Purpose of This Project
This website will hold a collection of learning videos geared towards toddler learning. In responce to COVID-19 users can also start a live learning session or join it if one has allready been started.

## Demo | Deploy
A live demo can be found [here]( https://macmididev.github.io/CInst-M3-Interactive-Development)

A GitRepo can be found [here](https://github.com/MACmidiDEV/CInst-M3-Interactive-Development)

This site is hosted using GitHub, deployed directly from the master branch to Heroku.

## UX

### User stories

As a parent of a toddler I can skip the search and make use of Little Links to find categories of learning videos.

COVID-19 distance learning Start a live video session to engage your neices and nefues.
This website will hold a collection of learning videos geared towards toddler learning. In response to COVID-19 a VideoChat service was implemented users can now start a live learning session or join it if one has already been started.

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access all information on the site while striving to keep the page with collected videos simple enough to be managed by a toddler.

### Scope
With COVID-19 we have to find use of all this new time MidiMaps is a great way to travel this world when you cannot be physically present

### Structure
With COVID-19 we have to find use of all this new time and still engage our children. Link Learning is a great way to begin to accomplish this task.

## Demo | Deploy
This site is hosted using GitHub, deployed directly from the master branch to Heroku.
The current site in production is hosted via [HEROKU](https://little-links-learning.herokuapp.com)
The GitRepo can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/MACmidiDEV/CInst-M3-Interactive-Development)

## Wireframes
- ![LittleLinks-DRAFT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MACmidiDEV/CInst-M3-Data-Centric-Development/master/LittleLinks/static/images/aDRAFT.jpg "Wireframe")

## Utilized Technologies
### Languages
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Jquery
- Python3

### Frameworks & Technologies
- Materialize: For responsive web designing
- Flask: HTML templating & routing
- Git: version control
- VSCode: code editor
- Github: hosts the website
- Jinja2: Python web template engine

### Database
- MongoDB: To store information into a database

## Environment and Configuration Variables
#### Local Variables
local env.py holds config vars 'SECRET_KEY', 'MONGO_URI' and 'DEVELOPMENT', which have the values that are required in the app.py file for the mongo URI password, the secret key password and the debug value.

#### Heroku Configuration Variables
heroku config vars 'IP', 'PORT', 'SECRET_KEY', 'MONGO_URI' and 'DEVELOPMENT' variables. The 'SECRET_KEY' and 'MONGO_URI' contain the same passwords on Heroku as they do locally in the env.py file. The 'DEVELOPMENT' variable is set to 1 during build and 0 in production

## Deployments and Installations
### Start A Virtual Environment & Install
- `python3 -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
for security purposes you will need your own database connection string to [mongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/)
